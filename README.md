### What the heck?

Whack-A-Mole is a CEX-DEX arbitrage bot written in Python.

Arbitrage strategies are like the global Whack-A-Mole game played in parallel.

Multiple players participate to find the mole that pops up, and jump to capture that opportunity.

Who knows who'll win...

What we know for certain is that you'll need a fast pair of eyes on the market at all times,
and an extra fast execution engine to capture the moment without latency.

Will our beloved Python be able to accomplish this? We'll see 😎

### Example Strategy #1: DEX arbitrage

The **main** branch is likely to go through a lot of changes, so to run an example that runs without breaking,
you should switch to the **examples/strategy/dex_arb_base** branch before running **main.py**. Run:

```
git checkout examples/strategy/dex_arb_base
```

### Example Strategy #2: CEX-DEX arbitrage

#### You said this is a CEX-DEX arbitrage bot, where the f is it?

I know...🥲 I'm still actively researching the CEX-DEX arbitrage space.

Everyone interested in the process can go visit my other repository which is actually a derivative of Whack-A-Mole:

https://github.com/solidquant/cex-dex-arb-research

This research template is an attempt to find alphas within the crypto space.

You can focus on DEX only arbs, CEX only arbs, and also CEX-DEX arbs using this template.
