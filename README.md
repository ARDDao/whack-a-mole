# Whack-A-Mole

CEX-DEX arbitrage bot written in Python.

Arbitrage strategies are like the global Whack-A-Mole game played in parallel.

Multiple players participate to find the mole that pops up, and jump to capture that opportunity.

Who knows who'll win...

What we know for certain is that you'll need a fast pair of eyes on the market at all times,
and an extra fast execution engine to capture the moment without latency.
